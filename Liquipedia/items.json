Interactions with the shop are important throughout the game, as it is in many cases the only way to acquire key items such as Boots of Speed, Staff of Teleportation, Scroll of Healing or Potion of Lesser Invulnerability.\nShop Control means ensuring to get important items from the Goblin Merchant.\nItems of particular contention are Boots of Speed, Potion of Invulnerability and Scroll of Healing.\nThere are multiple possibilities to get shop control. By having Map Control a player can stay close to the Goblin Merchant and prevent the opponent from getting\nto the shop.\nThe right timings are very important for getting the items before the opponent. High mobility heroes like the Blademaster and items such as Boots of Speed or the Staff of Teleportation can help\nto get to the shop.\nShop Control is especially important on Echo Isles, because there is only one shop on the map. If a player manages to get Boots of Speed for a powerful melee Hero such as the Blademaster or the Demon Hunter,\nthe player will be able to chase down the enemy hero and get map control in the early game.\nA player can buy items from the shop in order to increase the strength of his army without having to spend lumber or go into upkeep.\n\n",
